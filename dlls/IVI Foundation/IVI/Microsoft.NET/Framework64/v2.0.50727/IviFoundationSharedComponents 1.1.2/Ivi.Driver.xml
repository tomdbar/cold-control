            The purpose of the .NET Session Factory is to provide to the client 
            application a simple mechanism for creating instances of IVI.NET drivers. 
            Additionally, the activation mechanism of the 
            .NET Session Factory provides a means of interchanging IVI.NET drivers 
            without modifying the client program source code.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            The present design of the .NET Session Factory relies on the 
            IVI Configuration Store to associate logical names or driver session names with 
            the specific drivers intended for use. The .NET Session Factory relies 
            on these mappings to resolve logical names or driver session names provided by a client 
            programmer to an assortment of initial settings provided in the 
            configuration store. Once the .NET Session Factory has instantiated a 
            driver according to the data in the configuration 
            store, then the client program communicates directly with the component, 
            with no intermediate run-time layer required to invoke methods.

            Instruments sometimes require an absolute time which exceeds the resolution of the .NET Framework DateTime
            struct. To address these cases, IVI.NET provides the PrecisionDateTime struct, which provides a level of
            resolution similar to that defined by the IEEE 1588 standard.  PrecisionDateTime supports a range of dates
            from January 1, 1970 through December 31, 9999.  Time is internally represented in seconds since January 1,
            1970 (the IEEE 1588 epoch 0).  PrecisionDateTime stores date and time with femtosecond (1.0e-15 second)
            resolution.  The PrecisionDateTime struct is always based on the Gregorian calendar.  Time may be UTC time,
            local time, or unspecified.

            <summary>
            Represents a time span with resolution suitable for LxiSync times.
            </summary>
            <remarks>
            Instruments sometimes require a time span which exceeds the resolution of the .NET Framework TimeSpan struct.
            To address these cases, IVI.NET provides the PrecisionTimeSpan struct, which provides a level of resolution
            similar to that defined by the IEEE 1588 standard.  PrecisionTimeSpan supports positive and negative time spans,
            with a maximum length exactly equal to the number of seconds from the start of day, January 1, 1970 through the
            end of day, December 31, 9999.  Time is internally represented in seconds.  PrecisionTimeSpan stores time with
            femtosecond (1.0e-15 second) resolution.

            PutElements sets all or part of the data array in a waveform, starting at the element specified by index, or
            (by default, if index is not used) at the beginning of the array.  index is the first element of the waveform
            data array to receive the new data.  If the array passed extends beyond the end of the Waveform, only
            the elements up to the length of the waveform are copied.  The implicit axis of the waveform is not
            changed by PutElements.
